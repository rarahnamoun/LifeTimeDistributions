# LifeTimeDistributions
This project investigates novel application of  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in modeling the lifetimes of  nodes in complex networks. The study explores the 
Configuration Model, a method for generating random graphs 
with prescribed degree sequences, and proposes a GNN 
architecture to predict the average lifetimes of nodes based on 
their degree distributions. The GNN model is trained and tested 
on datasets generated using different statistical distributions, 
including Weibull, Exponential, and Pareto. The performance 
of the model is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) 
metric, which quantifies the accuracy of the predicted average 
lifetimes compared to the actual values. The experimental 
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GNN 
approach in predicting node lifetimes across various network 
configurations and statistical distributions. This project
contributes to the understanding of complex network dynamics 
and offers insights into the application of machine learning 
techniques for analyzing network behavior and longevity.
